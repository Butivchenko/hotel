# Goal

Modify the template (`index.php` and any other files you need to create in the child theme) and add the necessary styles, so that the list of rooms looks as close to the following as possible:

You can ignore the icon next to the room size.

You can ask questions if you get stuck.

Push to this repo when you're done.
